📅 Weekly Summary: Market Dynamics During the Christmas Holiday
With the Christmas holiday approaching, data releases are relatively sparse this week. However, key indicators—specifically bond auctions, GDP revisions, and employment data—remain crucial. We are closely monitoring how these events influence expectations for Fed policy, inflation, and growth signals.

⚠️ ParisTrader Note: Due to thin liquidity on December 25-26, we are halting all intraday trading and EA operations. Please manage your risk accordingly.

📊 Key Economic Calendar (ET)
Monday, Dec 22: Bond Market Test

13:00 2-Year Treasury Auction ($69B): Strong demand could reflect expectations for lower short-term yields; weak demand may signal capital outflow risks.

Tuesday, Dec 23: Growth & Confidence

08:30 Q3 GDP (2nd Revision): Est. 3.3% (Consensus 3.2%). Resilient growth, driven by AI and data center investment, could boost equity optimism, though a Q4 government shutdown may weigh on full-year projections.

08:30 Durable Goods: Watch for "Ex-Transport" data; AI-related electrical equipment investment is a key bright spot.

10:00 Consumer Confidence: Improved employment supports confidence; a beat here favors retail stocks.

Wednesday, Dec 24: Jobs & Inflation Expectations

08:30 Initial Jobless Claims: Est. 225k. Lower-than-expected numbers would reinforce labor market resilience, potentially dampening calls for Fed rate cuts.

11:30 7-Year Treasury Auction: A key test for long-end yields and inflation expectations.

Dec 25-26 (Thu/Fri): Christmas Holiday. Markets closed / No major data.

🚀 Asset Class Outlook & Strategy
1. FX: Dollar Selling Pressure & The JPY Carry

Analysis: Despite selling pressure on the Yen, the USD faces broader outflows. However, with Japan's real yields remaining negative, USD/JPY has decoupled from interest rate differentials, rendering verbal intervention ineffective.

ParisTrader View: Central bank dynamics in Asia continue to favor carry trade strategies.

Action: Reduce short-term USD longs; pivot to EUR or CAD. Continue to hold Long USDJPY (Our swing strategy performed excellently last week!).

2. Equities: AI Fatigue & New Directions for 2026

Analysis: The AI trade is showing signs of valuation fatigue (selling in Nvidia/Oracle) but hasn't collapsed, stabilized by strong earnings from Micron. Soft data has not altered the probability of a January rate cut.

ParisTrader View: While maintaining AI exposure, we are diversifying into new themes for 2026.

Action: Allocate towards Space, AI Power/Energy, and Autonomous Driving sectors.

📢 Coming Soon: I will be releasing a video detailing the high-probability trends and sectors for 2026.

3. Commodities: The Silver & Copper "Super Cycle"

Analysis: ETF flows are shifting to Silver. Copper is nearing record highs, driven by AI infrastructure needs and supply disruptions (Chile/Peru). Gold faces softer demand despite its annual rally.

ParisTrader View: Copper and Silver are in a "Commodity Control Cycle," where policy distortions outweigh simple supply/demand.

Action:

Silver/Copper: Rotate into Long positions as an AI/Electrification play (We entered Silver 2 weeks ago with solid returns).

Gold: Hold as a hedge; use our XAUUSD M1 EA for intraday scalping.

🔮 Year-End Lookahead (Dec 29-31)
As we close out 2025, focus shifts to Pending Home Sales, Case-Shiller Home Price Index, and FOMC Minutes. These will shape expectations for the anticipated 100 bps Fed rate cuts in 2026. If economic data confirms resilience, the year-end optimism is likely to extend into the new year.
